# Simple icons

This is a simple icon theme for Visual Studio Code that strives to be simple, using official icons when possible.
I often take inspiration from other themes such as [VSCode icons](https://github.com/robertohuertasm/vscode-icons), [Material icon theme](https://github.com/PKief/vscode-extension-material-icon-theme), and [Nomo dark icons](https://github.com/be5invis/vscode-iconset).
Thanks to Roberto Huertas, Philipp Kief and be5invis for these icon themes !

## Note

As I am still not completely sure about the definitive rules to make this theme's icons, I will probably not be taking pull requests.
Any suggestion is still welcome however, just open an issue on the Github repo.
