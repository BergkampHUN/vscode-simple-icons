# Simple icons

This is a simple icon theme for Visual Studio Code that strives to be simple, using official icons when possible.

## Note

As I am still not completely sure about the definitive rules to make this theme's icons, I will probably not be taking pull requests.
Any suggestion is still welcome however !
